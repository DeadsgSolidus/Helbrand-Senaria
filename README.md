You are not a hero, you are whoever you NEED to be!
Senaria may seem innocent, but look deeper...
The Helbrand is borne upon them ALL!
Are you truly able to muster?!
Can you extinguish the Great Dark?!
What does it mean to be a HERO?!
Sometimes we can never know...
Maybe, We should simply let fate decide?
